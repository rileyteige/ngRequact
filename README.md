=========

Combines RequireJS, AngularJS and React. The primary goal of this research is to exercise modularization and high UI performance while simultaneously utilizing a highly functional framework.

### Why these three frameworks?

#### RequireJS
I use RequireJS for modularization of all JavaScript, Angular-based or not.

#### AngularJS
Given Angular's design goals, we include Angular as a demonstration of a highly functional JavaScript framework.

#### React
One of Angular's downsides has been rendering performance; React was designed specifically for rendering speed.
